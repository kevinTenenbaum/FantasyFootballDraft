# Rankings Summary

The app ranks players by scraping projections from [fantasypros.com](http://fantasypros.com) and adjusting them based on a value-based drafting philosophy. This philosophy allows you to set *replacement levels* for each position and rank players by the difference in projected points between the player in question and the replacement level player at their position.
